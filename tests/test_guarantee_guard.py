"""G16 -- no test module sits outside the guarantee registry.

**THE HOLE THIS CLOSES.** `conftest.py` fails a run when a REGISTERED GUARANTEE
did not run and pass. That is a set comparison over guarantee ids, so it is blind
to a test module that registers nothing at all: skip it, delete it, or let it
stop collecting, and every gate stays green because no id went missing.

Two modules here were in exactly that position -- `test_contract_is_generated.py`
and `test_fixture_axes.py`, 16 tests carrying the anti-prose controls and the
controls on the fixtures the DST guarantee is measured with. A review skipped
`test_fixture_axes.py` at module level and the suite reported 124 passed, exit 0,
with nothing in CI referencing it. A sibling repository shipped the same shape:
21 tests outside both guards, containing all three of its anti-prose controls.

Registering those modules by hand fixes today. **This fixes tomorrow, and it is
DERIVED**: the module set comes off the filesystem and the marks come out of the
AST, so a file that arrives next round cannot arrive unnoticed.

**READ WITH THE AST, NEVER WITH A REGEX.** This file writes
`@pytest.mark.guarantee(...)` inside the string literal it plants below. A text
scan would count that as a mark on THIS module and report it guarded whatever its
real decorators said -- a check measuring the word instead of the shape, which is
the failure this project keeps cataloguing.
